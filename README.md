__Abstract:__ We adapt a West Nile Virus (WNV) epidemic model that demonstrates the interaction between avian hosts and mosquito vectors into a more comprehensive, early-season model by adding intrinsic growth and death rates of hosts, as well as horizontal transmission. We then parameterize this model based on bird demographics in Rutherford County, TN and investigate the effect of our modifications on the basic reproduction number, $R_0$. The behavior of a single-host model and a multi-compartment model which categorize the bird groups by WNV mortality rates are compared. It is seen that an epidemic will occur followed by stabilization of host populations dependent on host susceptibility to the virus.
